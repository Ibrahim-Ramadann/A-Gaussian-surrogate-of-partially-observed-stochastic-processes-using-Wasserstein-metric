# A-Gaussian-surrogate-of-partially-observed-stochastic-processes-using-Wasserstein-metric
Approximating the evolution of probability measures for nonlinear stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) and the associated nonlinear filtering problems is a challenging problem as it
involves solving high-dimensional differential equations. In contrast to classical variational infer
ence methods which address this challenge by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between the true and approximate distributions, we propose a Wasserstein-based variational
framework for approximating the laws of stochastic systems. In particular, instead of minimizing
the KL divergence, our approach minimizes the Wasserstein-2 (W2) distance between the joint
probability distributions of the state and observation processes. This formulation respects the
underlying transport geometry and results in evolution equations for Gaussian parameters that
provide an approximation of the dynamics of the true measure.
